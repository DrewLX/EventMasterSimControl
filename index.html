    <h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About</h3>

    This app is an evolution upon the work started by Nick Lloyd. I had the pleasure of knowing Nick since we were both at school together, and continued to regularly work together until he died in October 2018. <br />
    <br />
    His E2 Simulator XML website was an invaluable resource and tool, however I wanted to take it a step further, and make the simulator even easier to use.<br />
    So now you can simply configure and hit start. The app generates the XML file and starts up the simulator all for you in one window.

    <h3><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> Setup</h3>
    Once the app is running, the first time you'll need to click the 'Set Path' button. This should be the root of the Event Master version you wish to use. <br />
    <br />
    For example on a mac something like <code>/Applications/EventMaster-6.2.47841</code><br /><br />
    On windows it would be <code>C:\Barco\EventMaster-6.2.47841</code><br />
    <br />
    Simply configure your Event Master, select your cards and hit 'Start'.

    <h3><i class="fas fa-history"></i> History</h3>
    Without this turning into an obituary, I do want to recognise the help, support, time and love that Nick gave to our community. I felt I should continue his work and create this app. If Barco create something better I will certainly welcome
    it, but in the meantime I hope this can be of use to the many Event Master operators and technicians around the world. <br />

    I have used as much of Nick's work as possible. All his styling, html and javascript still remains. The rest of this app just adds the new functionality of passing the xml directly to the drive and executing the simulator.<br />

    As before, this is provided as is, it should work but I do not have time to test across systems, and configs.<br />
    However, if you have comments, questions you can get to me on social as <strong style="color: white;">@DrewLX</strong> or e-mail: <a href="mailto:me@drewperry.co.uk">me@drewperry.co.uk</a>

    This is free software. I'm not doing this for income, just because I felt it was right.<br />
    That said, I have had many people asking about donations so I have set up this page: <br /><br />
